## Setup
To work on the mini-projects you need to install additional python packages in
your conda environment `lsmlsda`:
1. Install brian2 in the environment:

    ```conda install -c brian-team brian2```

2. Install neurodynex in the environment:

    ```conda install -c epfl-lcn neurodynex```

### Brian2

The majority of exercises uses brian2 as neural simulator. We refer to the official
 [brian2 tutorials](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/index.html)
to make onself familiar with the main concepts:
- [neurons](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/1-intro-to-brian-neurons.html),
- [synapses](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/2-intro-to-brian-synapses.html),
- and [simulations](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/tutorials/3-intro-to-brian-simulations.html).

### Neurodynex

The exercises also make use of the package [neurodynex](https://github.com/EPFL-LCN/neuronaldynamics-exercises).
