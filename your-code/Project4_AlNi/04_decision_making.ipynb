    "\n",
    "- In this exercise we study decision making in a network of competing populations of spiking neurons. The network has been proposed by Wong and Wang in 2006 [1] as a model of decision making in a visual motion detection task. The decision making task and the network are described in the [Neuronal Dynamics by Gerstner - Chapter 16](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.html) and in the original publication (see location-references [1]). Read the introduction of chapter [16, Competing populations and decision making](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.html). To understand the mechanism of decision making in a network, read [16.2, Competition through common inhibition](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.S2.html).\n",
