    "Our goal is to simulate a decision making process. A very much simplified approach to that is to simulate a biased random walk: We simulate an internal decision variable, e.g., some neural activity, using a single scalar variable. At every time step, the variable evolves in a certain direction due to sensory evidence for a decision in that direction (drift, $\\mu$), plus noise (diffusion, $\\sigma$). Such a model is often called a drift-diffusion model. A simple form of the drift diffusion model is given by\n",

    "dX = \\mu \\mathrm{dt} + \\sigma \\mathrm{dW} ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the decision making process as a drift-diffusion process we have to integrate this equation. Because it is a stochastic differential equation (sde) we cant use standard implementation like scipy odeint for integration. Therefore, your first task is to implement your own Euler-Marayuma sde solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler-Maruyama is an extension of the simple Euler method to stochastic differential equations where we here only consider Gaussian noise processes. Euler-Maruyama\n",

    "Write a function euler_maruyama(ffun, gfun, x0, t, \\**args) which implements this equation\n",
